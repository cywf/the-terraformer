# The Terraformer

The Terraformer is an open-source project that aims to streamline the process of infrastructure provisioning and management by leveraging the power of ChatGPT and AutoGPT. This project provides a ChatGPT plugin to interact with AutoGPT, which in turn provisions infrastructure using Terraform and Ansible.

## Features

- ChatGPT plugin for seamless interaction with the infrastructure.
- AutoGPT integration for automated infrastructure provisioning.
- Terraform and Ansible for creating, updating, and managing infrastructure.
- Support for ZeroTier (private networking) and Tailwinds (VPN) integration.
- Docker and Kubernetes integration for containerizing and orchestrating applications.
- Version control with GitHub and Terraform Cloud for managing infrastructure.
